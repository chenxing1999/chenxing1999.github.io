I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Queensland, Australia. I am currently working on model efficiency for recommender systems, advised by [Dr. Rocky Tong Chen](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/profile/1253/rocky-chen) and [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home).

Previously, I was a researcher and engineer at [Cinnamon AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cinnamoninc/), where I led numerous client projects (e.g. [CHRONUS](https://www.kline.co.jp/en/news/drybulk/drybulk-20231023.html)) and various internal researches.

In 2021, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree from the Honors Program of the Department of Information Technology, [Ho Chi Minh City University of Science, Vietnam National University (VNU-HCMUS)](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/).
